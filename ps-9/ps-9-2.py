Exercise 8.7 in Newman. (Pg. 352)
Before approaching the problem numerically, 
show that set of possible values of R, ρ, C, m, and g maps to a one-parameter family of solutions, 
which in terms of a typical timescale T is controlled by the combination R^2ρCgT^2/m. 
That is, show that if you rescale variables from t to t′/T and from x to an appropriate x′, 
you get a unitless set of equations with one free (unitless) parameter.
